# iowa-bird-ms
 A sample of work I conducted for my MS at Iowa State regarding bird-habitat relationships. Because the work isn't published in a peer-reviewed outlet, the data presented are are a subset of what I used for my thesis, and the scripts generally represent analyses that didn't make it into my thesis (those analyses were done with a computer cluster by interfacing with Slurm). See my thesis for full representation of my analysis methods and results.
