# iowa-bird-ms
 A sample of work I conducted for my MS at Iowa State regarding bird-habitat relationships. Because the work isn't publishe in a peer-reviewed outlet, he data presented are are a subset of what I used for my thesis, and the scripts represent analyses that didn't make it in my thesis. See my thesis for full representation of my analysis methods and results
